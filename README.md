# Employee Tracker

This application allows you to keep track of as well as update an employee database using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL all in VS Code.

## IMPORTANT NOTE:

Manually install the MySQL schema located in the 'db' folder. Install 'schema.sql' first to create the database, and then run 'insert.sql' to insert values into the database.
